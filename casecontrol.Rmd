# Background
Reports based on cases seen in hospitals hve suggested that in those with severe disease the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease is higher than expected, and that a higher than expected proportion of severe cases are of non-European ethnic origin. Quantification of the risk associated with these characteristics and co-morbidities has been limited by the lack of an appropriate background population comparator. Furthermore it has not been possible to disentangle whether drug effects may underlie the apparent association with certain co-morbid groups. 

The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for severe or fatal cases of COVID-19 confirmed by testing.  Specific objectives were to test hypotheses about drugs classes associated with altered risk, and to construct a risk prediction algorithm that can be used to identify high-risk individuals who could be offered shielding during the epidemic.  To achieve this aim we conducted a case-control study of all severe and fatal cases in Scotland, with controls matched for age, sex and primary care practice. 

# Methods
## Case definition 
The Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS) database captures all virology testing in all NHS laboratories nationally, using the Community Health Index (CHI) identifier.  The CHI number is a unique identifier for everyone in the population, and is used in all care systems in Scotland.  All individuals testing positive for nucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 up to `r format(max(cc.all$SPECDATE, na.rm=TRUE), "%d %B %Y")` were ascertained.  Admissions to critical care were obtained from the national audit database of the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group (SICSAG)ical care units (SICSAG). Hospital admissions from the time of testing were obtained from the RAPID-24 database which is updated each day. 
Death registrations up to `r format(max(cc.all$Date.Death, na.rm=TRUE), "%d %B %Y")`
and cause of death were obtained from linkage to the National Register of Scotland.  

We classified test-positive cases into three groups: 

1. Severe or fatal COVID-19, defined by a record of entering critical care in the SICSAG database, or death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test regardless of the cause of death given on the death certificate. 

2. Hospitalised but not severe as defined above

3. Not hospitalised

By restricting the case definition to a group that combines those receiving critical care with those who died without receiving critical care, we ensure complete ascertainment of severe test-positive cases, whatever selection procedures may have been in place to exclude those assessed as unlikely to benefit from critical care.  This focus on severe or fatal disease is relevant to policy because decisions about control measures have been based on projections of the requirement for critical care. 

In national mortality data, XX % of those certified with COVID-19 as underlying case of death had a positive test record.  

## Matched controls
For each test-positive case, we ascertained ten matched controls of the same sex, one year age band and attending the same General Practice as each case alive on the same day as the date of test in the case. Note that this is an incidence density sampling design i.e. a control who becomes a case at a later point is retained in the control set. With this design, the odds ratios in a conditional logistic regression model are equivalent to rate ratios.  

## Demographic data
Ethnicity of cases and controls was classified using a name classification algorithm [@lakha_name_2011] with the names in the CHI database.  This is able to distinguish South Asian and Chinese groups from the White group, but misclassifies Black-Caribbean people (a relatively small group in Scotland) as White.  For those with a hospital admission record, a separate coding of ethnicity was available using self-described categories based on those used in the national census.  Socioeconomic status was scored as the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, based on the postcode in the CHI database.  

## Morbidity and drug prescribing

All cases and Using the CHI identifier, records from ECOSS were linked to hospital discharge records in the Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01).  and 

For all cases and controls, ICD-10 diagnostic codes were extracted from the last five years of hospital discharge records in the Scottish Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01, excluding records of discharges less than 25 days before testing positive for SARS-Cov-2. BNF drug codes were extracted from the last year of encashed prescriptions, excluding those encashed less than 15 days before testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.  Diagnosed cases of diabetes were identified through linkage to the national diabetes register (SCI-Diabetes), with a clinical classification of diabetes type as Type 1, Type 2 or Other.  

We initially examined history of a specific list of conditions and drug classes that have been advised as high risk conditions for COVID-19 by Public Health England, World Health organisation or the US Centres for Disease Control. 

Co-morbid conditions were assigned based on either a diagnostic code in any hospital discharge record during the last five years, or an encashed prescription of a drug for which that diagnostic code is the only indication.  

The ICD-10 codes and drug codes used to define each variable are listed in Supplementary Materials.  


## Statistical methods

We calculated the sex and age band specific cumulative incidence of severe COVID-19 disease using the age and sex distribution of those alive in the population as of March 1st 2020. (CHECK) 

The univariate association of each variable with severe COVID-19 was modelled with conditional logistic regression, implemented as Cox regression in the R function `survival::clogit`

We tested each effect for interaction with age and sex.  Effect of interest 

The analyses were repeated after excluding those aged over 75 years. 

To construct a risk prediction model, we used stepwise regression alternating between forward and backward steps, implemented in the R function `stats::step`, so as to maximize the AIC. 

The performance of the risk prediction model as a classifier was examined by n-fold cross-validation, with performance calculated over all test folds as the expected information for discrimination and (more conventionally) as the C-statistic.

## Information governance
This research was conducted under approvals A(i) PBPP approvals for accessing ?????; (ii) existing PBPP approval that allows HPS staff to link any PHI controlled datasets; (janet to add detail and reference numbers?) (iii) PBPP amendment (1617-0147) that covers inward transfer of diabetes data. Datasets were de-identified before analysis.  

# Results
## Comparison of severe cases with others who tested positive 
We emphasize that because testing was used selectively over this period, those who tested positive and were never hospitalised are unlikely to be representative of never-hospitalized cases in the population.  

## Association of demographic factors with severe disease

For the case-control comparison, this version of the manuscript restricts the dataset to those aged less than `r max(cc.severe$AGE) + 1` years.  

Table \ref{tab:demog} shows univariate associations of demographic factors with disease.  Higher risk of severe disease was associated with socioeconomic deprivation and with residence in a care home.  In comparison with those classified as White, South Asians and other non-White ethnic minorities were at lower risk of severe disease.  


```{r demog, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pvalue <- pvalue.latex(univariate.demog[, 5])
ci <- or.ci(univariate.demog[, 1], univariate.demog[, 3]) 
table.demog.aug <- data.frame(table.demog,
                                   ci, 
                                   pvalue)
colnames(table.demog.aug) <- c("Controls", "Cases", "Rate ratio (95% CI)", "p-value")
rownames(table.demog.aug) <- replace.names(rownames(table.demog.aug))
 
pander(table.demog.aug, 
       digits=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1),
       round=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 10),
	   split.tables="Inf",
       align=rep("centre", 4), 
       split.cells=c(16, 16, 25, 8),
       caption="\\label{tab:demog}Univariate associations of severe disease with demographic factors")

```

## Associations of comorbid conditions with severe disease
In univariate logistic regression models, both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were associated with severe disease (Table \ref{tab:conditions}. There were strong associations with circulatory disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease and neurological disease.  No association of severe disease with cystic fibrosis was detected.  A possible explanation for this may be that this group was effectively shielded from infection in accordance with official guidance.

```{r conditions, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

pvalue <- pvalue.latex(univariate.conditions[, 5])
ci <- or.ci(univariate.conditions[, 1], univariate.conditions[, 3]) 
table.conditions.aug <- data.frame(table.conditions,
                                   ci, 
                                   pvalue)
colnames(table.conditions.aug) <- c("Controls", "Cases", "Rate ratio (95% CI)", "p-value")
rownames(table.conditions.aug) <- replace.names(rownames(table.conditions.aug))

pander(table.conditions.aug, 
       digits=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1),
       round=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 10),
	   split.tables="Inf",
       split.cells=c(20, 20, 20, 7),
       caption="\\label{tab:conditions}Univariate association of severe disease with comorbid conditions")

```

Further analyses to adjust for co-morbidity ...

### Counts of co-morbid conditions

Table xx shows the distribution of numbers of the co-morbid conditions listed by WHO or CDC or PHE by age band in severe cases versus their controls. 
Across each age band there were people with severe COVID-19 who did not appear to have any of these co-morbid conditions.

## Associations of prescribed drugs with severe disease 
Table \ref{tab:drugs} shows that severe disease was associated with use of antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, and lipid-lowering agents.  Use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was not associated with higher risk than use of other classes of antihypertensive agent.  Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents was weakly associated with severe disease.  Use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with severe disease.

```{r drugs, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

pvalue <- pvalue.latex(univariate.drugs[, 5])
ci <- or.ci(univariate.drugs[, 1], univariate.drugs[, 3]) 
table.drugs.aug <- data.frame(table.drugs,
                                   ci, 
                                   pvalue)
colnames(table.drugs.aug) <- c("Controls", "Cases", "Rate ratio (95% CI)", "p-value")
rownames(table.drugs.aug) <- replace.names(rownames(table.drugs.aug))

pander(table.drugs.aug, 
       digits=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1),
       round=c(0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 10),
	   split.tables="Inf",
       split.cells=c(20, 20, 20, 7), 
       caption="\\label{tab:drugs}Univariate association of severe disease with drugs prescribed in last year")

```

## Examining those with no apparent co-morbid conditions

A more in depth focus on severe cases at younger ages 

As shown in table  among severe case below age 50  xxx% had either xxx or xxx or xxx but in xxx% none of these comorbid conditions were found. Among severe case below age 50-70  xxx% had either xxx or xxx or xxx but in xxx% none of these comorbid conditions were found.  However in those with none of these co morbid conditions xx% were on   drugs for xxx xxx and xxx.

## Multivariate analysis of risk factors for severe disease 

A stepwise regression procedure was carried out with all demographic, morbidity and drug exposure variables, using alternating forward-backward selection.  The `r nrow(stepwise.all)` variables retained are shown in Table \ref{tab:stepwise}


```{r model, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

table.stepwise <- as.data.frame(stepwise.all[, c(1, 5)])
table.stepwise[, 1] <- exp(table.stepwise[, 1])
colnames(table.stepwise) <- c("Rate ratio", "p.value")
rownames(table.stepwise) <- replace.names(rownames(table.stepwise))

table.stepwise$p.value <- pvalue.latex(table.stepwise$p.value)

pander(table.stepwise, table.style="multiline",
       # split.cells=c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5), 
	   digits=c(3, 1), 
	   split.table="Inf",
       caption="\\label{tab:stepwise}Stepwise regression: variables retained in model for severe disease")

```

## Predictive performance of a risk classifier
The predictive performance of the model chosen by stepwise regression was estimated by `r nfold`-fold cross-validation, and comparing observed and predicted case status over all test folds.  Table \ref{tab:wevid} shows that the C-statistic was `r summary(all.densities)[3]` and the expected information for discrimination was  `r summary(all.densities)[5]` bits.

```{r infodiscrim, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

pander(summary(all.densities), table.style="multiline",
       split.cells=c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5), split.table="Inf",
       caption="\\label{tab:wevid}Prediction of severe COVID-19: cross-validation of model chosen by stepwise regression" )

# Discussion

What is the explanation of the 14-fold higher incidence of severe disease in those who have encashed at least one prescription in the last year?
