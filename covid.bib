  abstract = {Background:
              There is currently a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The intensity and duration of this first wave in the UK may be dependent on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmits more effectively in the winter than the summer and the UK Government response is partially built upon the assumption that those infected will develop immunity to reinfection in the short term. In this paper we examine evidence for seasonality and immunity to laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) from a prospective cohort study in England.
            
            
              Methods:
              In this analysis of the Flu Watch cohort, we examine seasonal trends for PCR-confirmed coronavirus infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) in all participants during winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) and during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (May-Sep 2009). We also included data from the pandemic and `post-pandemic' winter seasons (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) to identify individuals with two confirmed HCoV infections and examine evidence for immunity against homologous reinfection.
            
            
              Results:
              We tested 1,104 swabs taken during respiratory illness and detected HCoV in 199 during the first four seasons. The rate of confirmed HCoV infection across all seasons was 390 (95\% CI 338-448) per 100,000 person-weeks; highest in the Nov-Mar 2008/9 season at 674 (95\%CI 537-835). The highest rate was in February at 759 (95\% CI 580-975). Data collected during May-Sep 2009 showed there was small amounts of ongoing transmission, with four cases detected during this period. Eight participants had two confirmed infections, of which none had the same strain twice.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Our results provide evidence that HCoV infection in England is most intense in winter, but that there is a small amount of ongoing transmission during summer periods. We found some evidence of immunity against homologous reinfection.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally. Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of "relapse" or "reinfection". The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Methods On 4/3-4/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity. We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test manufacturer9s data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both. Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5\% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97\%), and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81\% (95CI 2.24-3.37\%). Under the three scenarios for test performance characteristics, the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49\% (95CI 1.80-3.17\%) to 4.16\% (2.58-5.70\%). These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In this study we demonstrate that the adoption of a segmenting and shielding (S\&amp;S) strategy could increase scope to partially exit COVID-19 lockdown while limiting the risk of an overwhelming second wave of infection. The S\&amp;S strategy has an antecedent in the "cocooning" of infants by immunisation of close family members (Forsyth et al., 2015), and forms a pillar of infection, prevention and control (IPC) strategies (RCN, 2017). We are unaware of it being proposed as a major public health initiative previously. We illustrate the S\&amp;S strategy using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the "shielders". We explore the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of 12 weeks after lockdown. The most important determinants of outcome are: i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general population segment and between the general and vulnerable segments; ii) the fraction of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; iii) adherence with need to be protected; and iv) the extent to which population immunity builds up in all segments. We explored the effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population. We illustrate how the potential for the relaxation of restrictions interacts with specific policy objectives. We show that the range of options for relaxation in the general population can be increased by maintaining restrictions on the shielder segment and by intensive routine screening of shielders. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. These relationships are difficult to quantify so close monitoring of the epidemic would be essential during and after the exit from lockdown. More generally, S\&amp;S has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury which can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, while abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.},

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020. Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19. Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29\%), uncomplicated diabetes (19\%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19\%) and asthma (14\%); 47\% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49\% of patients were discharged alive, 33\% have died and 17\% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17\% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31\% were discharged alive, 45\% died and 24\% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20\% were discharged alive, 53\% died and 27\% remained in hospital. Conclusions: We present the largest detailed description of COVID-19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials have yielded inconsistent findings about the association between the use of acid-suppressive drugs and the risk of pneumonia. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize this association.
METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], Embase and the Cochrane Library) from inception to Aug. 28, 2009. Two evaluators independently extracted data. Because of heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled estimates of effect.
RESULTS: We identified 31 studies: five case-control studies, three cohort studies and 23 randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis of the eight observational studies showed that the overall risk of pneumonia was higher among people using proton pump inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.46, I(2) 90.5\%) and histamine(2) receptor antagonists (adjusted OR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.09-1.36, I(2) 0.0\%). In the randomized controlled trials, use of histamine(2) receptor antagonists was associated with an elevated risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (relative risk 1.22, 95\% CI 1.01-1.48, I(2) 30.6\%).
INTERPRETATION: Use of a proton pump inhibitor or histamine(2) receptor antagonist may be associated with an increased risk of both community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Given these potential adverse effects, clinicians should use caution in prescribing acid-suppressive drugs for patients at risk.},

  abstract = {Objectives
Primary care high-risk prescribing causes significant harm, but it is unclear if it is largely driven by individuals (a `bad apple' problem) or by practices having higher or lower risk prescribing cultures (a `spoiled barrel' problem). The study aimed to examine the extent of variation in high-risk prescribing between individual prescribers and between the practices they work in.

Design, setting and participants
Multilevel logistic regression modelling of routine cross-sectional data from 38 Scottish general practices for 181\hspace{0.25em}010 encounters between 398 general practitioners (GPs) and 26\hspace{0.25em}539 patients particularly vulnerable to adverse drug events (ADEs) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to age, comorbidity or co-prescribing.

Outcome measure
Initiation of a new NSAID prescription in an encounter between GPs and eligible patients.

Results
A new high-risk NSAID was initiated in 1953 encounters (1.1\% of encounters, 7.4\% of patients). Older patients, those with more vulnerabilities to NSAID ADEs and those with polypharmacy were less likely to have a high-risk NSAID initiated, consistent with GPs generally recognising the risk of NSAIDs in eligible patients. Male GPs were more likely to initiate a high-risk NSAID than female GPs (OR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.39 to 2.16). After accounting for patient characteristics, 4.2\% (95\% CI 2.1 to 8.3) of the variation in high-risk NSAID prescribing was attributable to variation between practices, and 14.2\% (95\% CI 11.4 to 17.3) to variation between GPs. Three practices had statistically higher than average high-risk prescribing, but only 15.7\% of GPs with higher than average high-risk prescribing and 18.5\% of patients receiving such a prescription were in these practices.

Conclusions
There was much more variation in high-risk prescribing between GPs than between practices, and only targeting practices with higher than average rates will miss most high-risk NSAID prescribing. Primary care prescribing safety improvement should ideally target all practices, but encourage practices to consider and act on variation between prescribers in the practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The escalating use of prescribed drugs has increasingly raised concerns about polypharmacy. This study aims to examine changes in rates of polypharmacy and potentially serious drug-drug interactions in a stable geographical population between 1995 and 2010.
METHODS: This is a repeated cross-sectional analysis of community-dispensed prescribing data for all 310,000 adults resident in the Tayside region of Scotland in 1995 and 2010. The number of drug classes dispensed and the number of potentially serious drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in the previous 84 days were calculated, and age-sex standardised rates in 1995 and 2010 compared. Patient characteristics associated with receipt of {$\geq$} 10 drugs and with the presence of one or more DDIs were examined using multilevel logistic regression to account for clustering of patients within primary care practices.
RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2010, the proportion of adults dispensed {$\geq$} 5 drugs doubled to 20.8\%, and the proportion dispensed {$\geq$} 10 tripled to 5.8\%. Receipt of {$\geq$} 10 drugs was strongly associated with increasing age (20-29 years, 0.3\%; {$\geq$} 80 years, 24.0\%; adjusted OR, 118.3; 95\% CI, 99.5-140.7) but was also independently more common in people living in more deprived areas (adjusted OR most vs. least deprived quintile, 2.36; 95\% CI, 2.22-2.51), and in people resident in a care home (adjusted OR, 2.88; 95\% CI, 2.65-3.13). The proportion with potentially serious drug-drug interactions more than doubled to 13\% of adults in 2010, and the number of drugs dispensed was the characteristic most strongly associated with this (10.9\% if dispensed 2-4 drugs vs. 80.8\% if dispensed {$\geq$} 15 drugs; adjusted OR, 26.8; 95\% CI 24.5-29.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Drug regimens are increasingly complex and potentially harmful, and people with polypharmacy need regular review and prescribing optimisation. Research is needed to better understand the impact of multiple interacting drugs as used in real-world practice and to evaluate the effect of medicine optimisation interventions on quality of life and mortality.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background Information on risk factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank. Methods UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. Interpretation These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 10 most widely used drugs in the world. PPI use has been associated with an increased risk of enteric infections, most notably Clostridium difficile. The gut microbiome plays an important role in enteric infections, by resisting or promoting colonisation by pathogens. In this study, we investigated the influence of PPI use on the gut microbiome.
METHODS: The gut microbiome composition of 1815 individuals, spanning three cohorts, was assessed by tag sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The difference in microbiota composition in PPI users versus non-users was analysed separately in each cohort, followed by a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: 211 of the participants were using PPIs at the moment of stool sampling. PPI use is associated with a significant decrease in Shannon's diversity and with changes in 20\% of the bacterial taxa (false discovery rate {$<$}0.05). Multiple oral bacteria were over-represented in the faecal microbiome of PPI-users, including the genus Rothia (p=9.8\texttimes 10(-38)). In PPI users we observed a significant increase in bacteria: genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and the potentially pathogenic species Escherichia coli.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences between PPI users and non-users observed in this study are consistently associated with changes towards a less healthy gut microbiome. These differences are in line with known changes that predispose to C. difficile infections and can potentially explain the increased risk of enteric infections in PPI users. On a population level, the effects of PPI are more prominent than the effects of antibiotics or other commonly used drugs.},

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to quantify the associations as presented in the literature and to also provide this information to healthcare professionals and patients about their potentially adverse effects. In July 2016, we searched through Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception using common keywords. We included observational studies that provided risk estimates on the long-term use of PPIs and their adverse effects. Overall, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, of which 28 studies were also included in the random effect meta-analysis. Odds of community-acquired pneumonia, hip fracture, and colorectal cancer were 67\% [odds ratio (OR)=1.67; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.67], 42\% (OR=1.42; 95\% CI: 1.33-1.53), and 55\% (OR=1.55; 95\% CI: 0.88-2.73) higher in patients with long-term PPIs use compared with patients who did not use PPIs. Although the use of PPIs provides short-term health benefits, their prolonged use is associated with minor and also potentially major adverse health outcomes. Hence, we strongly recommend that the prescription of PPIs should be done with caution to improve the medication's efficacy and patients' safety.},

  abstract = {AIM: Proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) are extensively prescribed worldwide. However, little information is available on PPI prescribing patterns, associated clinical and demographic factors, and potential drug-drug interactions in frail older patients.
METHODS: Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, and full medication exposure were collected in a consecutive series of 361 older patients (age 84 {$\pm$} 7 years) admitted to two acute geriatric admission units (Aberdeen, National Health Service Grampian) between 1 February 2010 and 30 June 2010. A set of predetermined criteria was used to assess appropriateness of PPI prescribing.
RESULTS: PPI were prescribed in 148 patients (41.0\%). Inappropriate overprescribing was observed in 127 patients (35.2\% of the study population, 85.8\% of patients prescribed PPI). PPI were inappropriately not prescribed in 20 patients (48.8\% of patients with an indication for PPI treatment). Regression analysis showed that the total number of non-PPI prescribed drugs (OR 1.08; 95\%CI 1.01-1.15) and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.08; 95\%CI 1.001-1.16) were independently associated with inappropriate PPI overprescribing. Potential drug-drug interactions were found in 75 patients (22.8\% of the study population), mainly in patients with PPI overprescribing.
CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriate PPI prescribing is common in frail older hospitalized patients, and might increase the risk of drug-drug interactions. Polypharmacy and comorbidity were independently associated with inappropriate PPI prescribing in this group.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health inequalities between ethnic minorities and the general population are persistent. Addressing them is hampered by the inability to classify individuals' ethnicity accurately. This is addressed by a new name-based ethnicity classification methodology called 'Onomap'. This paper evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of Onomap in identifying population groups by ethnicity, and discusses applications to public health practice.
STUDY DESIGN: Onomap was applied to three independent reference datasets (birth registration, pupil census and register of Polish health professionals) collected in Britain and Poland at individual level (n = 260,748).
METHODS: Results were compared with the reference database ethnicity 'gold standard'. Outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals and Chi-squared tests were used.
RESULTS: Onomap identified the majority of those in the British participant group with high sensitivity and PPV ({$>$}95\%), and low misclassification ({$<$}5\%), although specificity and NPV were lowest in this group (56-87\%). Outcome measures for all other non-British groupings were high for specificity and NPV ({$>$}98\%), but variable for sensitivity and PPV (17-89\%). Differences in misclassification by gender were statistically significant. Using maiden name rather than married name in women improved classification outcomes for those born in the British Isles (0.53\%, 95\% confidence interval 0.26-0.8\%; P {$<$} 0.001) but not for South Asian or Polish groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Onomap offers an effective methodology for identifying population groups in both health-related and educational datasets, categorizing populations into a variety of ethnic groups. This evaluation suggests that it can successfully assist health researchers, planners and policy makers in identifying and addressing health inequalities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most frequently prescribed medications. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity, mortality and healthcare spending. Some studies suggest an increased risk of CAP among PPI users. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between outpatient PPI therapy and risk of CAP in adults.
METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus and Web of Science on February 3, 2014. Case-control studies, case-crossover, cohort studies and randomized controlled trials reporting outpatient PPI exposure and CAP diagnosis for patients {$\geq$}18 years old were eligible. Our primary outcome was the association between CAP and PPI therapy. A secondary outcome examined the risk of hospitalization for CAP and subgroup analyses evaluated the association between PPI use and CAP among patients of different age groups, by different PPI doses, and by different durations of PPI therapy.
RESULTS: Systematic review of 33 studies was performed, of which 26 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These 26 studies included 226,769 cases of CAP among 6,351,656 participants. We observed a pooled risk of CAP with ambulatory PPI therapy of 1.49 (95\% CI 1.16, 1.92; I2 99.2\%). This risk was increased during the first month of therapy (OR 2.10; 95\% CI 1.39, 3.16), regardless of PPI dose or patient age. PPI therapy also increased risk for hospitalization for CAP (OR 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.12, 2.31).
DISCUSSION: Outpatient PPI use is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of CAP, with the highest risk within the first 30 days after initiation of therapy. Providers should be aware of this risk when considering PPI use, especially in cases where alternative regimens may be available or the benefits of PPI use are uncertain.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Polypharmacy has been linked to a myriad of adverse consequences, and escalating rates of polypharmacy present an emerging concern, particularly among older adults. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature concerning the association between polypharmacy and mortality.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review was done by searching the EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstract databases to identify studies assessing the association between polypharmacy and death published until June~2016.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that investigated the association between polypharmacy and mortality were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by the first and second authors independently using a data extraction form. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. A meta-analysis was performed using random effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The underlying populations were heterogeneous (I2= 91.5\%). When defined as a discrete variable, pooled risk estimates demonstrated a significant association between polypharmacy and death (pooled-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.08 [95\% CI 1.04-1.12]). When defined categorically, a dose-response relationship was observed across escalating thresholds for defining polypharmacy. Categorical thresholds for polypharmacy using values of 1-4 medications, 5 medications, and 6-9 medications were significantly associated with death (P {$<$}0.05; aOR 1.24 [1.10-1.39], aOR 1.31 [1.17, 1.47], and aOR 1.59 [1.36-1.87], respectively). Excessive polypharmacy (ie, the use of 10 or more medications) was also associated with death (aOR 1.96 [1.42-2.71]).
CONCLUSIONS: Pooled risk estimates from this meta-analysis reveal that polypharmacy is associated with increased mortality risk, using both discrete and categorical definitions. The causality of this relationship remains unclear, but it emphasizes the need for approaches to health care delivery that achieve an optimal balance of risk and benefit in medication prescribing.},

In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of Fc{$\gamma$}R reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the prerequisite for treatment and preventive quarantine. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8\% (79/80), 93.8\% (75/80) and 93.8\% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1\%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3\% for both, p\&lt;0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100\%, 96.7\% and 93.3\% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) remain one of the world's most frequently prescribed medications and there is a growing number of publications on correct versus incorrect use of PPIs worldwide. The objective of this observational retrospective study was to assess changes in PPI prescribing trends over the past decade and pharmacists' effect on optimizing PPI prescribing practice at a tertiary hospital in China.
METHODS: We collected the prescriptions of PPIs in our hospital from January 2007 to December 2016. Then the rate of PPI prescribing, the defined daily doses (DDDs) and expenditures were calculated and plotted to show the change in utilization of and expenditure on PPIs. Reasons behind this change and effect of pharmacists' intervention were evaluated by investigating the rationality of PPI use through sample surveys of patients of pre-intervention (Jul.-Dec. 2015) and post-intervention (Jul.-Dec. 2016).
RESULTS: In outpatient settings, the rate of PPI prescribing remained almost constant, utilization (from 135,808 DDDs to 722,943 DDDs) and expenditure (from 1.85 million CNY to 7.96 million CNY) increased for the past ten years, dominated by oral formulations and rabeprazole. In contrast, in inpatient settings, the rate of PPI prescribing (from 20.41 to 37.21\%), utilization (from 132,329 DDDs to 827,747 DDDs) and expenditure (from 3.15 million CNY to 25.29 million CNY) increased from 2007 to 2015 and then decreased, dominated by injection formulations and omeprazole. Pharmacist interventions could significantly promote the rational use of PPIs (44.00\% versus 26.67\%), decrease PPI use and reduce patients' charges (P\,{$<$}\,0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of and expenditure on PPIs grew due to the increase of patients and irrational use of PPI. Pharmacist interventions help to reduce PPI utilization and expenditure and enhance rationality for inpatients, but much work should be done to regulate injection and originator formulas, and improve the rationality in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Although population-wide lockdowns have been successful in slowing the COVID-19 epidemic, there is a consensus among disease modellers that keeping the load on critical care services within manageable limits will require an adaptive social distancing strategy, alternating cycles of relaxation and re-imposition until a vaccine is available. An alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and others at high risk of severe disease, while allowing immunity to build up in those at low risk until the entire population is protected. We examine the performance required from a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is relaxed. We show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for population-level immunity, the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 15\% of the population. Under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio (from 0.1\% to 0.4\%) and the performance of the classifier (3 to 4.5 bits of information for discrimination), we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group. We show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information from age, sex and medical records, at least 80\% of those who would die if unshielded would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15\% of the population. Although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does not vary much with the infection fatality ratio, the absolute number of deaths in the unshielded varies from less than 10,000 if the infection fatality rate is 0.1\% to more than 50,000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 0.4\%. For projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy, studies now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties: the extent to which infection confers immunity, the prevalence of immunity, the infection fatality ratio, and the performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records. It is time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the COVID-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity, avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Although the C-statistic is widely used for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests, its limitations for evaluating the predictive performance of biomarker panels have been widely discussed. The increment in C obtained by adding a new biomarker to a predictive model has no direct interpretation, and the relevance of the C-statistic to risk stratification is not obvious. This paper proposes that the C-statistic should be replaced by the expected information for discriminating between cases and non-cases (expected weight of evidence, denoted as {$\Lambda$}), and that the strength of evidence favouring one model over another should be evaluated by cross-validation as the difference in test log-likelihoods. Contributions of independent variables to predictive performance are additive on the scale of {$\Lambda$}. Where the effective number of independent predictors is large, the value of {$\Lambda$} is sufficient to characterize fully how the predictor will stratify risk in a population with given prior probability of disease, and the C-statistic can be interpreted as a mapping of {$\Lambda$} to the interval from 0.5 to 1. Even where this asymptotic relationship does not hold, there is a one-to-one mapping between the distributions in cases and non-cases of the weight of evidence favouring case over non-case status, and the quantiles of these distributions can be used to calculate how the predictor will stratify risk. This proposed approach to reporting predictive performance is demonstrated by analysis of a dataset on the contribution of microbiome profile to diagnosis of colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 and to lay the basis for risk stratification based on demographic data and health records. Methods: The design was a matched case-control study. Severe cases were all those with a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 in the national database who had entered a critical care unit or died within 28 days of the first positive test. Ten controls per case matched for sex, age and primary care practice were selected from the population register. All diagnostic codes from the past five years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past nine months were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Findings: In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios were 2.26 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.86 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio (95\% CI) 14.9 (12.7, 17.5). Univariate rate ratios (95\% CIs) for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 4.88 (3.26, 7.31) for Type 1 diabetes, 2.58 (2.30, 2.88) for Type 2 diabetes, 2.40 (2.14, 2.70) for ischemic heart disease, 3.90 (3.52, 4.32) for other heart disease, 3.10 (2.81, 3.42) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 12.1 (8.4, 17.4) for chronic kidney disease, 5.5 (4.8, 6.2) for neurological disease, 4.70 (2.90, 7.62) for chronic liver disease and 4.11 (2.72, 6.21) for immune deficiency or suppression. 72\% of cases and 35\% of controls had at least one listed condition (50\% of cases and 9\% of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past nine months and with at least one hospital admission in the past five years [rate ratios 16.6 (13.3, 20.6)] and 5.6 (5.0, 6.2) respectively] even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 1.81 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses and prescriptions provided an additional 1.5 bits (C-statistic 0.839). Conclusions: Along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95\%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95\%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95\%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1\% (95\%CrI: 13.5-26.6\%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04\% (95\% CrI: 0.03-0.06\%) and 0.12\% (95\%CrI: 0.08-0.17\%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19\% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The present study studied the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in SARS patients and evaluated the clinical significance of these antibodies.
METHODS: Two methods, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay, were used for the detection of the anti-SARS-CoV IgG and IgM in 335 serial sera from 98 SARS patients. In 18 patients, serum antibody profiles were investigated and antibody neutralization tests were performed from 7 to 720 days after the onset of symptoms.
RESULTS: The ratios of positive IgG/IgM by ELISA were 0/0, 45.4/39.4, 88.6/71.4, 96/88, 100/48.6, 100/30.9, 100/17.1, 100/0 per cent, respectively, on 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29-60, 61-90, 91-180 and 181-720 days after the onset of symptoms. Antibodies were not detected within the first 7 days of illness, but IgG titre increased dramatically on day 15, reaching a peak on day 60, and remained high until day 180 from when it declined gradually until day 720. IgM was detected on day 15 and rapidly reached a peak, then declined gradually until it was undetectable on day 180. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the convalescence sera from SARS patients.
CONCLUSION: The persistence of detectable IgG antibodies and neutralizing viral antibodies for up to 720 days suggest that SARS patients may be protected from recurrent SARS-CoV infection for up to 2 years.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background Understanding of the role of ethnicity and socioeconomic position in the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. Methods The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including Townsend deprivation index and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for: being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 1,474 had been tested and 669 had tested positive between 16 March and 13 April 2020. Black, south Asian and white Irish people were more likely to have confirmed infection (RR 4.01 (95\%CI 2.92-5.12); RR 2.11 (95\%CI 1.43-3.10); and RR 1.60 (95\% CI 1.08-2.38) respectively) and were more likely to be hospitalised compared to White British. While they were more likely to be tested, they were also more likely to test positive. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Area socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 1.91 (95\%CI 1.53-2.38); and RR 2.26 (95\%CI 1.76-2.90) respectively). Interpretation Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, measured baseline health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required. Funding Medical Research Council, Chief Scientist Office.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Main outcome measures Association of community acquired pneumonia with PPI prescription estimated by three methods: a multivariable Cox model comparing risk in PPI exposed patients with controls, corrected for potential confounders; a self controlled case series; and a prior event rate ratio (PERR) analysis over the 12 month periods before and after the first PPI prescription.
Results 160 000 new PPI users were examined. The adjusted Cox regression showed a risk of community acquired pneumonia 1.67 (95\% confidence interval 1.55 to 1.79) times higher for patients exposed to PPI than for controls. In the self controlled case series, among 48 451 PPI exposed patients with a record of community acquired pneumonia, the incidence rate ratio was 1.19 (95\% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.25) in the 30 days after PPI prescription but was higher in the 30 days before a PPI prescription (1.92, 1.84 to 2.00). The Cox regressions for prior event rate ratio similarly showed a greater increase in community acquired pneumonia in the year before than the year after PPI prescription, such that the analysis showed a reduced relative risk of pneumonia associated with PPI use (prior event rate ratio 0.91, 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.99).
Conclusion The association between the use of PPIs and risk of community acquired pneumonia is likely to be due entirely to confounding factors.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of residents receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for evidence-based indications in a large sample of Italian nursing homes (NHs) and to assess the predictors of potentially inappropriate prescriptions.
METHODS: This study was conducted in a sample of Italian long-term care NHs. Information on drug prescription, diseases, and socio-demographic characteristics of NH residents was collected three times during 2018. Appropriate use of PPI was defined in accordance with the strongest evidence-based indications and the Italian criteria for PPI prescription.
RESULTS: Among the 2579 patients recruited from 27 long-term care NHs, 1177 (45.6\%) were receiving PPIs; 597 (50.7\%) were taking them for evidence-based indications. Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and mean number of drugs were the most important predictors of inappropriate PPIs prescriptions. NH residents receiving {$\geq$}13 drugs had about 10 times the risk of receiving a PPI than those taking 0 to 4 drugs. Similarly, residents with more comorbidity had about 2.5 times the risk of receiving a PPI than those in better health. The prevalence of residents inappropriately treated with PPI in individual NHs varied widely, ranging from 22\% to 63\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Number of drugs, comorbidity, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants are the most important predictors of the inappropriate use of PPI in NHs. The wide variability between NHs in the appropriate use of PPIs suggests the need for thorough drug review in this fragile and vulnerable population. Prescribing patterns linked to evidence-based guidelines and national recommendations are essential for rational, cost-effective use of PPIs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test whether the use of potentially inappropriate central nervous system acting medications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or polypharmacy are associated with mortality in cognitively impaired older adults and whether frailer people are at greater risk of harm.
SETTING: A cohort study nested within the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II, a population representative cohort study of the older population in Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1154 cognitively impaired participants, aged 65 years or older.
EXPOSURES: Any use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, other anticholinergic medication, benzodiazepines or PPIs, polypharmacy (5-9) and hyperpolypharmacy ({$\geq$}10 reported medications) were ascertained at baseline. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Mortality up to 8 years follow-up. HRs associated with potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), frailty and their interaction were estimated adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Within the sample, 44\% were taking one or more PIM. Apart from antipsychotics (adjusted HR=3.24, 95\% CI 1.83 to 5.73), use of specific PIM was not associated with greater subsequent mortality. Polypharmacy (HR=1.17, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.45) and hyperpolypharmacy were associated with mortality (HR=1.60, 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.22). Being frail (HR=1.90, 95\% CI 1.32 to 2.72) or prefrail (HR=1.56, 95\% CI 1.10 to 2.20) was associated with increased mortality. There was some evidence that the HR for polypharmacy on mortality was lower among frailer individuals, but the overall polypharmacy by frailty interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.102).
CONCLUSIONS: For those with cognitive impairment, greater concern should be afforded to the number of medications than the prescription of specific classes. Frailer individuals may have a lower relative risk of mortality associated with polypharmacy than less frail individuals.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Hospitalization is associated with microbiome perturbation (dysbiosis), and this perturbation is more severe in patients treated with antimicrobials.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether hospitalizations known to be associated with periods of microbiome perturbation are associated with increased risk of severe sepsis after hospital discharge.
METHODS: We studied participants in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study with linked Medicare claims (1998-2010). We measured whether three hospitalization types associated with increasing severity of probable dysbiosis (non-infection-related hospitalization, infection-related hospitalization, and hospitalization with Clostridium difficile infection [CDI]) were associated with increasing risk for severe sepsis in the 90 days after hospital discharge. We used two study designs: the first was a longitudinal design with between-person comparisons and the second was a self-controlled case series design using within-person comparison.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 43,095 hospitalizations among 10,996 Health and Retirement Study-Medicare participants. In the 90 days following non-infection-related hospitalization, infection-related hospitalization, and hospitalization with CDI, adjusted probabilities of subsequent admission for severe sepsis were 4.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-4.4\%), 7.1\% (95\% CI, 6.6-7.6\%), and 10.7\% (95\% CI, 7.7-13.8\%), respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of severe sepsis was 3.3-fold greater during the 90 days after hospitalizations than during other observation periods. The IRR was 30\% greater after an infection-related hospitalization versus a non-infection-related hospitalization. The IRR was 70\% greater after a hospitalization with CDI than an infection-related hospitalization without CDI.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong dose-response relationship between events known to result in dysbiosis and subsequent severe sepsis hospitalization that is not present for rehospitalization for nonsepsis diagnoses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first generic PPI was introduced in Spain in 2001, and since then their prescriptions have increased steadily by about 200\%.
AIM: To evaluate the frequency of use and the appropriateness of indications of PPIs in hospitalised patients, and possible factors predicting their use. We also evaluated relevant PPI-drug interactions and serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, prescription-indication drug-utilisation study in hospitalised patients with follow-up until discharge. Sampling was random and stratified by services, and was calculated to obtain an error in the precision of prescription of {$\pm$}4\% with a 95\% confidence interval with maximum variability (50\%).
RESULTS: 328 patients were included; 28.65\% were prescribed a PPI at admission, 82.62\% were prescribed a PPI during hospitalisation, and 54.75\% at discharge, with inappropriate indications in 74.47\%, 61.25\% and 80.24\% respectively. The OR of being discharged with PPIs was 3.01(95\% CI:2.17-4.18, p=0.000). The inappropriate indication most frequently seen at admission and at discharge was antiplatelet therapy. During hospitalisation it was prophylaxis for stress ulcer in patients at low risk. PPI prescription at admission remained at discharge in 75.90\% of cases, 73.02\% without an acceptable indication. Being {$>$}64 years old, taking {$>$}4 drugs, co-medication (NSAIDs, antiaggregation and anticoagulation), certain hospital departments and length of stay {$>$}15 days predicted 83.7\% of prescriptions at discharge. Four relevant PPI-drug interactions were found, and 2 resulted in SADRs, thus the incidence per 1, 000 patients was 2.66 (Poisson 95\% CI:0.62-7.23).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a very high frequency of overuse of PPIs in inpatients and outpatients. Hospitalisation did not represent an opportunity for better prescription of PPIs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between PPI use and CAP in adults followed in general practices in the United Kingdom.
DESIGN: Nested case-control study.
SETTING: The General Practice Research Database (1987 to 2002) in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients age 18 years or older with at least 6 months of initial pneumonia-free follow-up in the database. Case patients (n = 80 066) were defined as those who received an incident diagnosis of CAP. Control participants (n = 799 881) were selected by using incidence density sampling, matching on practice site, calendar period, and follow-up duration.
MEASUREMENTS: Use of PPIs within 30 days before the index date. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Overall, current PPI use was not associated with an increased risk for CAP (adjusted OR, 1.02 [95\% CI, 0.97 to 1.08]) or risk for CAP that required hospitalization (adjusted OR, 1.01 [CI, 0.91 to 1.12]). There was a strong increase in risk for CAP associated with current use of PPI therapy that was started within the previous 2 days (adjusted OR, 6.53 [CI, 3.95 to 10.80]), 7 days (adjusted OR, 3.79 [CI, 2.66 to 5.42]), and 14 days (adjusted OR, 3.21 [CI, 2.46 to 4.18]), but there was no statistically significant association for longer-term current PPI therapy. A separate matched case-control analysis, which included the 3 strongest confounders as additional matching factors, yielded similar results as the primary analysis (adjusted OR, 0.96 [CI, 0.91 to 1.02]).
LIMITATIONS: Adherence to PPI prescription was assumed to be 100\%. No radiographic evidence was available to corroborate a diagnosis of CAP.
CONCLUSION: Proton-pump inhibitor therapy started within the past 30 days was associated with an increased risk for CAP, whereas longer-term current use was not.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the risk of recurrence in adults who survived first-episode severe sepsis for at least 3 months.
DESIGN: A matched cohort study.
SETTING: Inpatient claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
SUBJECTS: We analyzed 10,818 adults who survived first-episode severe sepsis without recurrence for at least 3 months in 2000 (SS group; mean age, 62.7 yr; men, 54.7\%) and a group of age/sex-matched (1:1) population controls who had no prior history of severe sepsis. All subjects were followed from the study entry to the occurrence of end-point, death, or until December 31, 2008, whichever date came first.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary end-point was severe sepsis that occurred after January 1, 2001 (the study entry). Relative risk of the end-point was assessed using competing risk regression model. During the follow-up period, severe sepsis and death occurred in 35.0\% and 26.5\% of SS group and in 4.3\% and 18.6\% of controls, respectively, representing a covariate-adjusted sub-hazard ratio of 8.89 (95\% CI, 8.04-9.83) for the risk of recurrence. In stratified analysis by patient characteristics, the sub-hazard ratios ranged from 7.74 in rural area residents to 23.17 in young adults. In subgroup analysis by first-episode infection sites in SS group, the sub-hazard ratios ranged from 4.82 in intra-abdominal infection to 9.99 in urinary tract infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of recurrence after surviving severe sepsis is substantial regardless of patient characteristics or infection sites. Further research is necessary to find underlying mechanisms for the high risk of recurrence in these patients.},

Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary. Data sources Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform. Population 17,425,445 adults. Time period 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020. Primary outcome Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19. Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95\%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95\% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95\% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95\% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95\% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95\% CI 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients9 records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background. The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used. Serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and seroconversion in this and other similar populations However, these data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control. Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease.
DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated i.m. on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology.
RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence.
CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95\% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95\% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67\% (95\% crI 3.56\%,3.80\%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38\% (95\% crI 1.23\%,1.53\%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66\% (0.39\%,1.33\%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Scotland's population has become increasingly ethnically diverse. The aim of this study was to better understand future changes to the ethnic profile of the population and the implications for population health. The literature regarding ethnicity and health, particularly in the Scottish context, was reviewed alongside analyses of past trends and new future projections (2011\textendash 2031) of the size of the non-White ethnic minority population in Scotland and Glasgow (Scotland's largest and most ethnically diverse city). The literature emphasises that the relationships between ethnicity, socioeconomic position (SEP) and health are extremely complex. In Scotland this complexity is arguably enhanced, given the different, less disadvantaged, SEP profile of many ethnic minority groups compared with those in other countries. Although indicators of overall health status have been shown to be better among many non-White ethnic minority groups compared with the White Scottish population, such analyses mask varying risks of particular diseases among different groups. This complexity extends to understanding the underlying causes of these differences, including the `healthy migrant' effect, `acculturation', and the impact of different types and measures of SEP. The proportion of the population belonging to a non-White ethnic group increased four-fold in both Scotland and Glasgow between 1991 and 2011. New projections suggest that by 2031, around 20\% of Glasgow's total population (and 25\% of children) will belong to a non-White minority group. Given this, there is a clear need for policy-makers and service-planners to seek to understand the implications of these changes to the Scottish population.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 confirmed deaths globally as of March 30, 2020 [1-4]. At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 9shield immunity9 at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients ({$\geq$}18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.
FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48\%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30\%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19\%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8\%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1{$\cdot$}10, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}03-1{$\cdot$}17, per year increase; p=0{$\cdot$}0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5{$\cdot$}65, 2{$\cdot$}61-12{$\cdot$}23; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 {$\mu$}g/mL (18{$\cdot$}42, 2{$\cdot$}64-128{$\cdot$}55; p=0{$\cdot$}0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20{$\cdot$}0 days (IQR 17{$\cdot$}0-24{$\cdot$}0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.
INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 {$\mu$}g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.
